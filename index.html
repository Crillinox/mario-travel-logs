    <p>It's a pretty nice place, however a big lizard stole my girl so never again. 10/10 with job opportunities, worked there most my life before travelling.</p>

    <p>Its a nice place but it has a bit too much litter around, and its a tourist hotspot so its kind of hard to get a more one-on-one photo, nice place irregardless</p>

    <p>Nice food and premiums, however expect most people to speak polish. Good food, nice places to sightsee, a bit crowded and a part of the commonwealth independent states that used to make of the USSR</p>
